The Digital Rhizome is a very small new-work collective - with individual workers spread between Capetown, Durban and Johannesburg (ZA)
We're focused on delivering digital tools, support and services. 

These include the development of custom apps and websites, turn-key software solutions and general technical services

We also dream public information infrastructure.
