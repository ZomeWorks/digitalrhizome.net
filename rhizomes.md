Rhizome is a term used to describe the relations and connectivity of things. A hyper-connected structure that appears to be an emergent organisational form in complex systems.

“Rhizome” referring to a relation like that of roots. They spread underground with no direction, no beginning, and no end. They are dispersed. It is opposed to the idea of a tree which has a starting point, and from there branches out in a predictable path.

The pattern repeatedly emerges throughout natural and designed systems:

* [large scale structure of the cosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe#Large-scale_structure)
* brain/connecteome 
* www, wikis
* social networks - software and real / communities 

features/aspects:
* hyperconnected
* acentered - no centre / starting point
* evolving/changeable --- growing/dying/branching/forking/strengthening/pruning
* heterogeneity - differing things can connect - any rhizomic structure can connect/extend/define sections of any other rhizome
* (self-similar at differing scales)?
