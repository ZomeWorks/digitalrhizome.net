PublicText - an idea for an interface for digital citizenry - using an open simple text standard for interoperability between communities and networks.

All this functionality can be wrapped by [zomestool/zometools](/projects/zomeworks)

## the idea
Visualising community functionality:
- identity management
- multiple communities - showing links within and between community content (visible side by side)
- consensus mechanisms 
- conflict / conflict resolution
    - discussion
    - in-community consensus mechanisms
    - forking content
    - forking community
    - showing contested content - links to alternatives 
        - sorting alternatives by sub-community size

- easy VentureCommune setup
- rewards/coin/reputation for 
    - public contribution
    - contribution vetting
    - consensus participation
    - pull requests
    - [wiki gnoming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiGnome)
    - micro work tasks

- Visual wrapper over versioning functionality
    - forking
    - contributions / pull requests
    - rewards / reputation 
    - showing contested content - links to alternatives
