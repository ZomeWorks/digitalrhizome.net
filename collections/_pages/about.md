The Digital Rhizome is a very small new-work collective - with individual workers spread between Capetown, Durban and Johannesburg (ZA)
We're focused on delivering digital tools, support and services. 

These include the development of custom apps and websites, turn-key software solutions and a growing list of technical services.
We also dream [public information infrastructure](/projects/zomeworks).
